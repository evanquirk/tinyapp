# TinyApp Project

You know what the internet needs? ANOTHER TINYAPP! So here is mine. It's mean, it's green, and I've tried to make it pretty lean. Me and this project go way back - all the way to Feb 15, 2021, and today - on Feb 19, 2021 I finally submit her to the world wide web. Be safe out there my App child. God Speed. 

Tiny App is a basic web application for shortening long URLs down to smaller ones to share on character limited threads like Twitter. So go out there and share good content, and be content we won't share your goods! (bcrypt/cookie session included to help protect your privacy).
